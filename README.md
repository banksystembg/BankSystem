# BankSystem 
**BankSystem** is an open-source web project where users can create bank accounts, transfer money, create payment cards, pay with them or directly through their account, etc.
It supports connecting multiple banks together through the _CentralApi_. This allows money to be securely transferred between **separate instances of BankSystem** running on different machines.

## Documentation

### [Getting started](https://github.com/banksystembg/BankSystem/wiki/Getting-started)
>**This page contains important information on how to properly configure BankSystem and CentralApi**

BankSystem consists of two base components - the bank web application and the _CentralApi_, which securely connects banks running on separate machines together to process [transfers between different banks](https://github.com/banksystembg/BankSystem/wiki/Money-transfers#Global--worldwide-transfers), [card payments](https://github.com/banksystembg/BankSystem/wiki/Cards#Purchases) and [direct payments](https://github.com/banksystembg/BankSystem/wiki/Direct-payments).

### [Bank accounts](https://github.com/banksystembg/BankSystem/wiki/Bank-accounts)
Bank accounts hold information about their owner, balance, transactions, date of creation, etc.

### [Money transfers](https://github.com/banksystembg/BankSystem/wiki/Money-transfers)
